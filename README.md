# cs128h-rust-project-mlp

## Group name: MLP
* Lydia Shin (lydiazs2)
* William Du (wwdu2)

## Project Introduction
#### Goals/Objective:
* A matrix calculator that can take in a matrix from the user and calculate/output determinant, inverse, row reduced echelon form, and basic operations (add, subtract, multiplication)
#### Why:
* Because it intersects Rust and what we are working on in other courses (linear algebra) so it is good practice for both courses.

## Technical Overview
* Please provide a moderate-length technical description of the major components of your project. This should also function as a sort of â€˜roadmapâ€™ for tasks you need to complete for your project to be functional.

#### Components:
* Take user input and save as a matrix and output a matrix (print out/display)
* have a matrix struct that implements all the functions (and helper functions) that calculate these operations
* Addition/subtraction
* Multiplication
* echelon form
* row reduced echelon form
* inverse
* determinant

#### Checkpoint 1 (4/3-4/7):
* The first four components in the bulleted list (last one being echelon form)
#### Checkpoint 2 (4/17-4/21):
* The rest of the components
## Possible Challenges
* Proper formatting and accessing elements
* Issues with size of the numbers in the matrices (integer overflow)
* Learning how to get user input
